# webgl-clock
Our project was to make a working cuckoo clock. That means: a clock that keeps the appropriate time 
and a short animation of a birdie "cuckoo-ing" outwards from the clock. The clock features and minute, 
second, and hour hand. Currently there are no user controls, the clock is autonomous. Because this is just a simple cuckoo-clock, there is not much in the way for user control.
